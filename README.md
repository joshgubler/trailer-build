# Trailer Build

## Introduction

![back wall](./pics/back-wall.jpg)
It's an 8'x20' car hauler, converted into a travel trailer. Commercially available travel trailers are poorly built, leak, and fall apart. Utility trailers don't have any of these problems. I expect this thing to last forever.

We didn't want to cut holes in the frame or skin, so we built a false wall on the back. This quickly became our main entrance/exit as it's much nicer than the side door on the trailer.

If I could change one thing, I would start with a lighter trailer. Car haulers have massive floor joists which just add unnecessary weight for a travel trailer.
